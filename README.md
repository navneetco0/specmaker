# First day 
we went through the flow of the website and we checked the functionality of the original website and coming to know we can make dynamic website as well as responsive. Later we communicated and divided our work accordingly to build a project.
We all are connected through zoom meet in the morning, evening hours and slack as well. We collected all the information about Specsmakers and which functionalities we have to add to our project. We break the projects into various parts and allotted them to each other. We started working on all features of the project separately and pushes the code to a different branch of our git-hub repo as a template and merge all the codes accordingly.
# OUR CHALLENGES :
We faced a lots of challenges while completing this project, The major problem was that we were working remotely so, communication and time management was major issue between us. As the project had short span of deadline so, on the last two days we all were working the whole night to complete our user-friendly website.
Making Responsive Website and adding java script features
Sliding images, adding hem-burger functionality to navbar
Creating own data which required for website
while merging code and commit data to repository
We all are SOLVED our challenges as a team with good team spirit and finally cloned the website.
Apart from these challenges we had some good things as a team like
